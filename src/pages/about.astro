        </h3>
        <p class="md:text-lg text-left text-text-medium mb-4">
          With over 30 years of experience as a Physical Therapist Assistant, I
          specialize in helping older adults stay strong, balanced, and
          independent, while also supporting individuals of all ages. I spent 15
          years working in home health care, providing therapy tailored to each
          clientâ€™s needs.

          <p class="md:text-lg text-left text-text-medium">
            In 2023, I founded Silver Coast Fitness to bring fitness and
            movement classes directly to clients, working with them in their
            homes or outdoor spaces. My expertise includes recovery and
            rehabilitation after hip and knee replacements, cardiac conditions,
            balance issues, and generalized weakness. I am certified in Basic
            Life Support (BLS) and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and have
            extensive experience creating personalized plans to improve
            strength, mobility, and overall quality of life.
